## Vision
The aim of this project is to design a portable synchronous buck converter system that acts as a constant power source. Such a system should be powered by Li-on cells and be capable of generating an output voltage of up to 3 V at a current of 30 A. The system should dynamically adapt to the load, ensuring a stable output power set by the user. The system should have a number of safety features, such as:

- **overcurrent protection**,
- **thermal protection**,
- **protection against excessive cell discharge**,
- **protection against incorrect cell polarity**,
- **protection against excessively high or low load impedance**.
