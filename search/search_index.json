Such a system should be powered by Li-on cells and be capable of generating an output voltage of up to 5 V and a current of up to 30 A. The system should dynamically adapt to the load, ensuring a stable output power set by the user. The system should have a number of safety features, such as:</p> <ul> <li>overcurrent protection,</li> <li>thermal protection,</li> <li>protection against excessive cell discharge,</li> <li>protection against incorrect cell polarity,</li> <li>protection against excessively high or low load impedance,</li> <li>greacefull degradation of output power in not-ideal conditions.</li> </ul>"}]}
